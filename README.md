# Fathom: the Strike market quality index

> **How deep is Strike's book?**
> Fathom records Strike's public **L3** (every resting order) BTC-USD feed live, measures its liquidity quality the
> same way as Binance and Hyperliquid, and publishes the result as a live scorecard, an open dataset and a read-only API.

**Live scorecard:** https://fathom-strike.vercel.app  |  **Demo video (2 min 43 s):** [fathom-demo.webm](https://github.com/SamuelDharshi/Fathom/releases/download/demo-v1/fathom-demo.webm)  |  **Strike feedback:** [FEEDBACK.md](FEEDBACK.md)

Everything here runs on **live public market data**. There is no mock data, no simulated order book and no seeded numbers.
The one model in the product (the incentive designer) is a clearly labelled what-if. See [FEEDBACK.md](FEEDBACK.md) for the
architectural pain point in Strike's L3 feed that this project surfaced, with evidence and a proposed fix.

---

## 1. The idea

**The problem.** Strike's perps volume is thin (roughly $0.3M a day on DefiLlama). Thin books mean slippage. Slippage keeps traders
and market makers away, and that keeps the books thin. Nobody outside Strike has an independent, public number for *how* thin the book
is, *versus whom*, or *whether a liquidity programme works*.

**The insight.** Strike publishes something almost no exchange does: a public **Level 3** feed, i.e. every individual resting order
with its FIFO position. L2 only tells you "$X at this price". L3 also tells you who is quoting, how long quotes live, what gets cancelled
and what actually trades. That is enough to measure liquidity *quality*, not just size.

**The product.** Fathom turns that feed into:

| What | For whom | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A live **scorecard**: spread uptime, depth, slippage at size, cancel/fill, depth resilience, next to Binance and Hyperliquid | Strike team, traders, judges | `/scorecard` |
| An **incentive designer**: "if we paid a 1 bp maker rebate to 3 Quoters, what would depth and slippage look like?" | Strike team sizing STRIKE spend | `/designer` |
| An **open dataset** (Parquet) and a **read-only API** with every outage marked | Builders, market makers | `/data`, `/api/*` |
| A one-page **methodology** with every definition and known limit | Anyone who wants to check our work | `/methodology` |

**The pitch.** *"Strike's problem is thin liquidity. This tells the team exactly how thin, versus whom, and what a rebate or Quoter
programme would buy, before they spend STRIKE on it."*

**What it is not.** No trading, no wallets, no funds, no predictions, BTC-USD only (the only symbol with public L3), and no claim about
exchange integrity. It measures liquidity, not honesty.

### 2.3 How one metric sample is made (walking the book)

```
   ASKS (lowest first)                     mid = (best bid + best ask) / 2
   $81,023  0.40 BTC   ────┐               spread = (ask - bid) / mid
   $81,021  0.10 BTC       │ buy $50k      depth within N bps = sum(price x size) for levels inside mid +- N bps
   $81,020  0.35 BTC   ────┘ walks up      slippage = (average fill price - mid) / mid
   ───────── mid $81,019.5 ─────────
   $81,019  0.30 BTC   ────┐ sell $50k
   $81,018  0.12 BTC       │ walks down    If the visible book cannot fill the order the sample is excluded
   $81,016  0.25 BTC   ────┘               from the average and the fill share is reported instead.
   BIDS (highest first)                    Benchmarks use the identical code (fathom/ladder.py).
```

### 2.4 What the user sees (page flow)

```

## 3. The metrics

All values are computed on a 2-second clock from the full local book and rolled up to 1-minute, hourly and daily windows.
Every number is shown with its sample count; recording gaps are excluded, never interpolated.

| # | Metric | Definition | Strike | Binance / Hyperliquid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| M1 | Spread uptime | Share of samples with a two-sided book and spread <= 5 bps | L3 book | L2 book |
| M2 | Depth within N bps | USD resting within 5, 10, 25 bps of mid, per side | L3 book | L2 book (n/a where the feed does not reach) |
| M3 | Slippage at size | Cost vs mid of a $10k / $50k / $100k market order, by walking the book | L3 book | L2 book |
| M4 | Cancel / fill | Cancelled size over filled size, plus counts of placed, cancelled, filled | L3 events | not available |
| M5 | Depth resilience | Time for depth within 10 bps to recover to 80% after a taker order above $10k | L3 events | not built |
| M6 | Flow toxicity | Average mid-price move in the taker's direction over the 10 s after each taker order | L3 events + Strike samples | not available |

## 4. Using the app

### 4.1 If you are on the Strike team (is our book healthy, and what would a programme buy?)

1. Open **/scorecard**. Pick a window (1 hour is the default). The four cards at the top are Strike on its own: spread uptime, depth
   within 10 bps, slippage for a $50k order and the cancel/fill ratio, each with the change against the window before it.
2. Scroll to **"Versus Binance and Hyperliquid"**. The gap is the size of the opportunity, not a verdict. `n/a` means the venue's public
   feed does not reach that price band; Fathom never extrapolates.
3. Open **/designer**. Enter a maker rebate (bps), the number of Quoters and each Quoter's quote size. Press *Model on the live book*.
   Read the table (recorded book vs modelled) and the printed assumptions. The banner reminds you this is a what-if, not a forecast.
   Change the assumed adverse-selection cost to see how sensitive the result is.
4. Open **/data** to download the evidence behind any number.

### 4.2 If you are a market maker or Quoter

Look at **depth within 5/10 bps**, **slippage** and the **"What only L3 shows"** section: how many orders are placed versus cancelled versus
filled, and how quickly depth returns after a large taker order (M5). The findings carousel on the landing page summarises it.

### 4.3 If you are a trader or builder

- On the landing page use the widget *"What does a market order cost right now?"*: pick $10k, $50k or $100k and compare Strike, Binance
  and Hyperliquid on the latest 2-second sample.
- Pull data programmatically:

```bash
# current health of the four feeds
curl http://localhost:8000/api/health

# scorecard for the last 60 minutes (all venues)
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/scorecard?window_minutes=60"

# metric values for a time range (unix ms), 1-minute buckets
curl "http://localhost:8000/api/query?start=1792700000000&end=1792703600000&step=minute"

# what the incentive model says (POST)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/designer -H "content-type: application/json" \
     -d '{"rebate_bps":1,"n_quoters":3,"quote_size_usd":50000}'

# list the Parquet files, then download one
curl http://localhost:8000/api/dataset
curl -O http://localhost:8000/api/dataset/gaps.parquet
```

### 4.4 API reference

## 5. Run it yourself

Prerequisites: Python 3.11+, Node 20+. No API keys, wallets or accounts are needed: every feed is public.

```bash
# 1. backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m fathom.recorder        # starts all four recorders, writes data/fathom.db
python -m fathom.api             # API on http://localhost:8000  (docs at /docs)

# 2. frontend
cd web
npm install
npm run build && npx next start -p 3002     # or: npm run dev
# the frontend reads NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL (web/.env.local); default http://localhost:8000
```

The recorder must run continuously. Strike has **no history endpoint**, so every hour it is down is a permanent, marked gap.
`run_recorder.cmd` restarts it if it exits; `deploy/*.service` and `docker-compose.yml` run it on a server.

Configuration lives in `.env` (see `.env.example`). Everything the product reads is public; the pending section lists only deployment
values you supply.

### 5.1 Verify our work

```bash
python -m fathom.verify           # sequence continuity, replay vs REST checkpoints, bookTicker cross-check
python -m fathom.verify --live    # sync a fresh book, run 30 s, diff against a brand-new REST snapshot
python -m pytest tests            # arithmetic tests + tests on recorded real data
node web/scripts/make_demo.mjs <url> demo   # records the captioned demo video of the live site (real data)
python -m fathom.analyze_churn    # reproduces every number quoted in FEEDBACK.md
```

What these show today: the rebuilt L3 book matches Strike's REST snapshots order for order in all checkpoint replays (zero mismatches,
zero sequence holes), a deliberately dropped real event is shown to corrupt the book (which is why any gap forces a rebuild), and
100% of L3 fills recorded while the market feed was connected appear on Strike's public trade tape.

---

## 6. Strike interactions (what we call, and why)

| Strike interface | Use in Fathom |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /v2/l3/snapshot?symbol=BTC-USD` | full book at a sequence: at every session start, and every 10 minutes as a verification checkpoint |
| `wss://api.strikefinance.org/ws/l3` (`btc-usd@l3`) | every order-level update; buffered, then applied from `last_sequence + 1` |
| `wss://api.strikefinance.org/ws/price` (`trade`, `bookTicker`) | public trade tape and top of book, to cross-check the rebuilt book |

Limits respected: one L3 connection, one market connection, one snapshot every 10 minutes (the limit is 10 per second). No
authentication is involved.

## 8. Honest limits

- **The PRD's data targets were not met.** The recorder started on Oct 22 at 00:54 IST. By Oct 23 10:36 IST that is 33.7 hours of wall-clock
  time, of which **11.3 hours were actually recorded (about 33%)**. The rest is 22.4 hours of marked gaps: one 1.2 h network drop and two
  laptop sleeps (12.9 h and 7.8 h). The PRD asked for 30+ hours recorded at 95%+ uptime. History cannot be backfilled because Strike has no
  replay endpoint. Live figures are at `/api/coverage` and on the scorecard; no gap is ever interpolated.
- **BTC-USD only**, because that is the only symbol with public L3.
- **Strike volume is very thin.** The dataset holds about 1,070 fills, so cancel/fill and depth resilience (M5) rest on small samples. Sample
  sizes are printed beside every number.
- **The Binance series mixes two instruments.** It is the USD-M perpetual (BTCUSDT) except from about Oct 22 19:26 IST to Oct 23 10:30 IST, when
  Binance's main domains were unreachable from the recorder host and it fell back to the public spot mirror. Each switch is logged and shown on the
  scorecard. Hyperliquid streams only 20 levels per side, so wide depth bands are `n/a`.
- **Strike's book is sampled between refresh bursts.** Strike refreshes its whole book once a second as about 190 unbracketed events, and
  sampling mid-burst understated Strike (spread uptime 86% instead of 100%). Strike samples are now taken between bursts, using Strike's own event timestamps, and Strike's history
  was re-derived from the raw stored events (`python -m fathom.resample`). Benchmark samples are live and were not rebuilt. Evidence and the proposed
  fix are in [FEEDBACK.md](FEEDBACK.md).
- **Visible liquidity only.** L3 shows resting orders, not intent, and an order can be cancelled before a taker reaches it. Strike's quotes
  are refreshed every second (median resting time 993 ms), so displayed depth reflects the refresh schedule as much as committed capital
  ([FEEDBACK.md](FEEDBACK.md), section 5).
- **The designer is a model**, not a forecast, and says so on the page.
- **M6 is Strike-only and coarse.** The price move uses the 2-second book samples (the last one before the trade and the first one at least 10 s
  after), over about 1,000 taker orders, so treat it as an average, not a per-trade measurement.

## 9. Live deployment

| Piece | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Frontend | https://fathom-strike.vercel.app (Next.js on Vercel, built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` pointing at the API) |
| API + recorder | the recorder machine, exposed through an ngrok HTTPS tunnel (India region) |
| Keep-alive | `supervise_stack.ps1` restarts the recorder, API, website and tunnel; sleep and hibernate are disabled on the host |

A tunnel to a laptop is not a production setup: the live numbers are only as available as that machine. The same code runs on any VPS with
`docker compose up -d` or the systemd units in `deploy/`, which is how it should be run long term. Set `ALERT_WEBHOOK_URL` in `.env` to get
a Discord or Slack message when a feed goes stale.
