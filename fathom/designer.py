"""Incentive designer: a parametric what-if model on the REAL current Strike book. Not a forecast.

Model (every assumption is returned with the result and printed beside it in the UI):
  participation = clamp(rebate_bps / adverse_selection_bps, 0, 1)
  added liquidity per side (USD) = n_quoters * quote_size_usd * participation
  The added size is placed at the current best bid and best ask (joining the touch), then M2 and M3 are
  recomputed on the resulting ladder with the same functions used for the live scorecard.
Nothing here predicts how makers or traders will actually behave.
