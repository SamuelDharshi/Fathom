"""Rebuild Strike's historical book_samples from the raw L3 events, sampling only at quiet moments.

Why: Strike refreshes its whole book once a second as one burst of ~190 separately sequenced cancel/open events with no
atomic boundary. Sampling the local book in the middle of a burst sees a half-empty book (about 14% of the old samples).
The raw events are all stored, so the history can be re-derived exactly: replay each session from its start snapshot and
take a sample whenever the stream goes quiet (>= QUIET_MS between consecutive event timestamps).

Run: python -m fathom.resample            (rebuilds everything recorded before burst-aware sampling started)
